About Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab**\n","- Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning etc.\n","- Google Colaboratory is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. \n","\n","**2.   About this lab**\n","\n","- In this lab we will explore and use Melbourne housepricing dataset.  Each row in the dataset is a housing sale and columns are the features of the sold house/appartment.\n","\n","\n","- The goal is to predict the price of new sales. We will build two supervised models: regression models and artificial neural network. ML pipeline outlined in the theory part of the course will be followed. \n","\n","\n","**3.
